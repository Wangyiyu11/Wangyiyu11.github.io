<h1> <FONT SIZE=4 > AirPods vs. AirPods Pro: Features Compared</FONT></h1>
<P>  AirPods Pro sport an all-new in-ear design with three sizes of soft, flexible silicone tips that click into place, including small, medium, and large. Meanwhile, the standard AirPods have a one-size fits all design. While many people found this adequate, some users had issues with the original AirPods design falling our or hurting their ears. Apple says the new tips are designed to conform to your ear shape, keeping the AirPods Pro secure, while a vent system equalizes pressure to minimize discomfort.  </P>

<h2> <FONT SIZE=4 > When Will iOS 14 Be Released?</FONT></h2>
<P>Apple typically previews its next-generation operating system for iPhones and iPads during its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California in early June, and then officially releases it to the public sometime in September. Apple won't be following its usual formula this year for obvious reasons. </P> 
<P>We don't know for sure when iOS 14 will be released this year, but the timeline of previous releases can give us an idea of when to expect. Last year, at its September 10 event where it unveiled the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, Apple announced that it would be releasing iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 in stages. </P>
