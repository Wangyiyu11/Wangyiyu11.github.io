	<h1>McDonald's responds to allegations that its food doesn't decompose again</h1>
<div class="wenzi01">
  <p> The Internet's collective colon was in a knot over recent reports of a McDonald's fare that allegedly failed to decompose after 20 years, but McDonald's maintains that its food like any other food-would decompose "in the right environment." </p>

<p> "But, in order to decompose, you need certain conditions specifically moisture. Without sufficient moisture either in the food itself or the environment bacteria and mold may not grow and therefore, decomposition is unlikely," McDonald's wrote in a media statement issued on Monday. </p>
<p> The company's remarks come after a TikTok user shared a video alleging that her grandmother had been keeping a McDonald's hamburger inside a box in her closet since 1996. In the user's video, the grandmother is seen opening the box to reveal what appears to be a hardened, preserved burger. She also took out some old fries that appeared as if they hadn't decomposed, either. </p>
