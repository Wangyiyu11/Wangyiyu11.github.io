<P> Cakes were called “plakous” by the Greeks, from the word for “flat.”  These cakes were usually combinations of nuts and honey.  They also had a cake called “satura,” which was a flat heavy cake. </P> 
<P> The terms “bread” and “cake” became interchangeable as years went by.  The words themselves are of Anglo Saxon origin, and it’s probable that the term cake was used for the smaller breads.  Cakes were usually baked for special occasions because they were made with the finest and most expensive ingredients available to the cook.  The wealthier you were, the more likely you might consume cake on a more frequent basis.  </P>
